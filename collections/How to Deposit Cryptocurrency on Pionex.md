## Step-by-Step Guide to Deposit Cryptocurrency  

### 1. **Access the Deposit Page on Pionex App**  
Log in to your Pionex account via the mobile app, then navigate to the **Deposit** section. This interface allows you to specify the cryptocurrency and blockchain network for your transfer.  

### 2. **Select the Correct Cryptocurrency and Blockchain Network**  
Choose the cryptocurrency you want to deposit (e.g., **USDT**) and the corresponding blockchain network (**BEP20 (BSC)** in this case). Pionex supports multiple networks, but selecting the wrong one can result in lost funds.  

üîç **Tip**: Use the search bar or scroll through the list to find your desired asset. If the cryptocurrency or network isn‚Äôt listed, Pionex doesn‚Äôt support it, and depositing it could lead to irreversible losses.  

### 3. **Copy the Deposit Address**  
Once you‚Äôve selected the correct cryptocurrency and network, Pionex will generate a unique **deposit address**. Copy this address carefully‚Äîany typo could send your funds to the wrong wallet.  

### 4. **Initiate the Transfer from Your Source Platform**  
Go to the withdrawal page on the exchange or wallet where your crypto is stored (e.g., **Binance**). Paste the Pionex deposit address, select **USDT** as the currency, and choose **BEP20 (BSC)** as the network.  

üö® **Critical**: Double-check the address and network before proceeding. Incorrect entries are the most common cause of lost deposits.  

### 5. **Confirm the Transaction**  
After verifying all details, submit the withdrawal request. The transfer typically takes a few minutes to several hours, depending on network congestion and confirmation requirements.

## Important Considerations for Deposits  

### **Minimum Deposit Requirements**  
Pionex enforces minimum deposit amounts to prevent insignificant transfers from clogging the blockchain. Deposits below this threshold will be lost permanently. Always check the **minimum deposit amount** for your chosen cryptocurrency before initiating a transfer.  

### **Transaction Fees**  
Depositing crypto to Pionex is **fee-free**. However, the source exchange or wallet will charge a **network fee** for initiating the withdrawal. This fee varies based on the cryptocurrency and network selected.  

### **Memo/Tag Requirements**  
Some cryptocurrencies (e.g., **XRP** or **BNB (BEP20)**) require a **Memo** or **Tag** to complete the deposit. This additional identifier ensures the funds are routed correctly. Failing to include it will result in a failed transaction.  

### **Why Isn‚Äôt My Deposit Showing Up?**  
If your deposit hasn‚Äôt arrived within the expected timeframe, check the transaction status using the **TxID (Transaction ID)** on a blockchain explorer. Here are the explorers for common networks:  

| **Blockchain Network** | **Explorer**           |  
|-------------------------|------------------------|  
| ERC20                   | [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/) |  
| TRC20                   | [Tronscan](https://tronscan.org/) |  
| BEP20 (BSC)             | [BscScan](https://bscscan.com/) |  

If the transaction is confirmed but still unprocessed, contact Pionex support for assistance.

### **3. What should I do if I sent crypto to the wrong address?**

### **4. Why is there a minimum deposit requirement?**

## Troubleshooting and Best Practices  

### **Verifying Transaction Details**

## Expand Your Crypto Knowledge  

Understanding blockchain networks and transaction mechanics is crucial for managing digital assets. For example:  

- **BEP20 (BSC)**: Offers faster transactions and lower fees than Ethereum.  
- **ERC20**: Widely supported but slower during peak congestion.  
- **TRC20**: Known for ultra-low fees but less adoption than BEP20.  

Choosing the right network can save time and money. Always research your options before initiating transfers.
