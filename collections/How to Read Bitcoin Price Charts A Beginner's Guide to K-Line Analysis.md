## K-Line Chart Fundamentals

### Core Components of a K-Line

Each candlestick represents price activity over a specific timeframe (5M, 15M, 1H, D1, W1, etc.). Four critical price points form the basis of every K-line:

| Element       | Description                          | Visual Indicator       |
|---------------|--------------------------------------|------------------------|
| Open Price    | Price at the start of the period     | Top/bottom of body     |
| Close Price   | Price at the end of the period       | Top/bottom of body     |
| High Price    | Highest price during the period      | Top wick               |
| Low Price     | Lowest price during the period       | Bottom wick            |

Color conventions:
- **Green/White**: Closing price > Opening price (Bullish)
- **Red/Black**: Closing price < Opening price (Bearish)

### Interpreting Candlestick Patterns

#### Basic Patterns and Market Psychology
- **Long Green Candle**: Strong buying pressure, continuation of uptrend
- **Long Red Candle**: Significant selling pressure, potential downtrend
- **Doji (Cross Star)**: Market indecision, potential reversal
- **Hammer**: Bullish reversal signal in downtrends (long lower wick)
- **Inverted Hammer**: Bearish reversal indicator in uptrends (long upper wick)

#### Composite Patterns
- **Bullish Engulfing**: Large green candle completely covering previous red candle
- **Bearish Engulfing**: Large red candle engulfing prior green candle
- **Morning Star/Evening Star**: Three-candle reversal patterns
