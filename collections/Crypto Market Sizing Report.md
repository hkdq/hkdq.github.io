### Ethereum: Layer-2 Innovations and ETF Launches

## Challenges and Considerations

- **Market Volatility**: Price swings in Q1 2024 temporarily slowed new user onboarding.  
- **Technological Barriers**: Scalability and energy consumption remain concerns for widespread blockchain adoption.  

## Regional Adoption Highlights  
While global data reveals overall growth, regional disparities persist:

- **Southeast Asia**: Rapid mobile-first crypto usage in countries like Vietnam and Indonesia.  
- **Europe**: Slower growth due to stringent MiCA regulations, though institutional interest is rising.
