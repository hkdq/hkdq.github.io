## Understanding Testnet Tokens  

Testnet tokens, such as **testnet AVAX**, are digital assets designed for use on test blockchain networks like **Avalanche Fuji**. These tokens mimic the behavior of real-world cryptocurrencies but hold no monetary value, making them ideal for testing and development.  

### Key Differences: Testnet vs. Mainnet  
| Feature              | Testnet (Fuji)              | Mainnet (Avalanche)          |  
|-----------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------|  
| Purpose               | Development & Testing       | Real-world Transactions      |  
| Token Value           | $0                          | Market-Driven Value          |  
| Security              | Lower (Experimental)        | High (Production-Grade)      |  
| Use Cases             | DApp Testing, Smart Contract Deployment | Live Transactions, Staking |  

Testnet networks like **Fuji** replicate the structure of the main Avalanche network, allowing developers to identify bugs, optimize user experiences, and ensure seamless deployment on the mainnet.
