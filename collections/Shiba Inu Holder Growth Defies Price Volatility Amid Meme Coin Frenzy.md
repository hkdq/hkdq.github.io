# Shiba Inu Holder Growth Defies Price Volatility Amid Meme Coin Frenzy  

## Shiba Inu Wallet Count Surpasses 900,000 Ethereum Addresses  

The Shiba Inu ($SHIB) ecosystem continues to expand its user base despite recent price corrections, with Ethereum wallet holdings crossing **912,290 addresses** as of November 2021. This milestone represents a **28% increase** from early October 2021, when SHIB holders numbered less than 700,000.  

According to Etherscan blockchain data, the surge in wallet adoption occurred simultaneously with SHIB's **900% price rally** over 90 days—a meteoric rise fueled by retail investor enthusiasm and strategic token burns reducing circulating supply. Notably, this growth persists even as SHIB's price retreated **25% over seven days**, highlighting divergent investor behaviors between accumulation trends and market valuations.

**Critical Considerations:**  
- Wallet counts ≠ individual holders (one investor may control multiple wallets)  
- Exchange-held SHIB complicates accurate owner statistics  
- Early adopters like the "Greatest Trade" investor (8,000 → $5.7B conversion) demonstrate SHIB's wealth-generation potential
