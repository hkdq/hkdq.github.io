# XRP (XRP) Price | XRP USD Price & Real-Time Chart  

## Overview of XRP  

XRP is a high-performance cryptocurrency built on the **XRP Ledger**, a decentralized blockchain designed to enable fast and cost-effective cross-border transactions. This digital asset serves as a bridge currency for global payments, with additional applications in decentralized finance (DeFi), tokenization, and everyday transactions. Created in 2012 by Jed McCaleb, Chris Larsen, and Arthur Britto, XRP has evolved into a cornerstone of Rippleâ€™s financial ecosystem, driven by a global community of developers and validators.  

### Key Features of XRP  
- **Fixed Supply**: Only 100 billion XRP tokens exist, with no further supply possible.  
- **Rippleâ€™s Role**: Ripple Labs holds 60% of the total supply, managed through escrow to regulate market distribution.  
- **Transaction Speed**: Processes transactions in under 5 seconds, handling over 1,500 transactions per second (TPS).  
- **Low Fees**: Transaction costs average $0.0001, with a small amount of XRP destroyed per transaction to prevent spam.

## XRP Ledger: Technical Insights  

The **XRP Ledger** operates on a unique consensus mechanism called **Federated Consensus**, differing from proof-of-work (PoW) or proof-of-stake (PoS). Validatorsâ€”trusted nodes on the networkâ€”agree on transaction validity without mining, ensuring rapid settlement and energy efficiency.  

### How XRP Transactions Work  
1. **Initiation**: Users send XRP through the ledger.  
2. **Validation**: Validators confirm transactions in under 5 seconds.  
3. **Finality**: Once validated, transactions are immutable.  

Developers can interact with the XRP Ledger via **HTTP/WebSocket APIs** or libraries in languages like Python, Java, and JavaScript.
