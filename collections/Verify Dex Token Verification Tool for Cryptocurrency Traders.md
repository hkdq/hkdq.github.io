## Key Features of Verify Dex

### 1. **DEX Screener Verification**
Verify Dex automatically checks if a token's information on [DEX Screener](https://www.dexscreener.com) has been officially updated through paid verification. This feature distinguishes legitimate projects from unverified ones, reducing the risk of interacting with fake or malicious tokens.

### 2. **Legitimate Social Links Display**
For verified tokens, the extension displays authentic project links, including:

- Twitter/X profile
- Telegram channels

This ensures traders connect directly with genuine projects, avoiding phishing attempts or counterfeit communities.

### 3. **Unpaid Token Alerts**
Tokens that haven't completed verification are clearly marked with visual indicators. While unpaid tokens may still display associated Pump.fun data, Verify Dex ensures users recognize their unverified status before engaging.

### 4. **Automatic Scanning**
The tool operates seamlessly in the background, instantly scanning tokens when users open charts on supported platforms. No manual input is required, making it ideal for both novice and experienced traders.

### 5. **Wide Platform Compatibility**
Verify Dex integrates with multiple DeFi analytics platforms, including:
- **Photon**
- **Bullx**
- **GMGN**
- **DEX Screener**

This cross-platform functionality provides consistent verification across popular trading interfaces.
