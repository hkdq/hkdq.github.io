- **Asset Management**: Automated protocols execute trades without intermediaries  

DeFiâ€™s $50B+ total value locked (TVL) demonstrates its growing influence, though scalability and security remain challenges.  

### 4. Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs)  
Over 130 countries are exploring CBDCs, with Chinaâ€™s Digital Yuan leading trials. Key advantages include:  
- **Financial Inclusion**: Access for unbanked populations  
- **Transaction Efficiency**: Near-instant cross-border payments  
- **Monetary Policy Control**: Enhanced central bank oversight  

The Bank for International Settlements predicts widespread CBDC adoption by 2030.

- Hedging through derivatives  

### 3. Cybersecurity Threats  
Over $4B was stolen from crypto exchanges in 2023 alone. Best practices for security:  
- Use hardware wallets from providers like Ledger or Trezor  
- Enable two-factor authentication (2FA)  
- Avoid suspicious decentralized apps (dApps)
